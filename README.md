Eidetica is a screenshot sharing application. When you take a screenshot, Eidetica will automatically upload it to your server and stick the link in your clipboard!

## Using Eidetica

### Quick Start

1. **Download and install the [latest version](//github.com/trezy/eidetica/releases/latest).**
1. **Run it.** You may get a warning saying that the app is from an untrusted source. That's because I don't have an official Apple cert yet. Once I have the money, I'll fix this one.
1. **Enter your server settings.** Check out the [wiki page](https://github.com/trezy/eidetica/wiki/Settings) if you're having trouble with your settings.
1. **Take a screenshot!** After a moment, you should receive a notification informing you that your screenshot has been uploaded to the server and a link to it has been placed in your clipboard.
