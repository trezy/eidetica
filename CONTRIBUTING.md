## Contributing to Eidetica

You want to contribute to the project? Awesome! Fork the repo, make some changes, and submit a PR. I don't have any tests yet so I'm obviously not going to be strict about that. If you write some, though, I'll love you forever.

### Getting the environment working

I recommend using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) since I try to keep the `yarn.lock` file up-to-date. If you don't use Yarn, you're far more likely to run into dependency version issues.

1. Clone the repo
  ```
  git clone git@github.com:trezy/eidetica.git
  cd eidetica
  ```
1. Install dependencies
  ```shell
  yarn install
  # or
  npm install
  ```
1. Run the app
  ```shell
  yarn run dev
  # or
  npm run dev
  ```
